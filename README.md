# Use Linux commands to manage file permissions
<h2>Description</h2>

This project demonstrates practical skills in managing file and directory permissions within a Linux environment, a fundamental aspect of operating system security. By implementing strict access controls, this activity showcases the principles of least privilege and data confidentiality, which are critical for maintaining a robust security posture.

<h2>Objective</h2>

The primary objective of this activity was to identify, interpret, and modify file and directory permissions to align with organisational security policies and best practices, thereby strengthening access controls and protecting sensitive data from unauthorised access or modification.

<h2>Tools & Technologies Used</h2>

* **Linux Operating System: (e.g., Ubuntu, Kali Linux â€“ specify if you used a particular distribution in the lab)**
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI): Bash Shell**
* **Linux Commands: ls -la, chmod**

<h2>Security Concepts Applied:</h2>

* **Principle of Least Privilege: Granting only the minimum necessary permissions for users and processes to perform their tasks.**
* **Access Control: Implementing mechanisms to restrict who can access and modify files and directories.**
* **Data Confidentiality & Integrity: Protecting sensitive information from unauthorised viewing (confidentiality) and unauthorised changes (integrity).**
* **Defence in Depth: Adding layers of security, where file permissions serve as a critical layer at the operating system level.**

<h2>Key Learnings & Takeaways:</h2>

* **Gained practical proficiency in using ls -la and chmod for effective Linux file system security management.**
* **Deepened understanding of how file permissions directly impact system security and data protection.**
* **Reinforced the importance of regularly reviewing and correctly setting permissions to prevent unauthorised access and maintain system integrity.**
* **Developed a more methodical approach to identifying and remediating access control misconfigurations.**
