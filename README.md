# Use Linux commands to manage file permissions
<h2>Description</h2>

This project demonstrates practical skills in managing file and directory permissions within a Linux environment, a fundamental aspect of operating system security. By implementing strict access controls, this activity showcases the principles of least privilege and data confidentiality, which are critical for maintaining a robust security posture.

<h2>Objective</h2>

The primary objective of this activity was to identify, interpret, and modify file and directory permissions to align with organisational security policies and best practices, thereby strengthening access controls and protecting sensitive data from unauthorised access or modification.

<h2>Tools & Technologies Used</h2>

* **Linux Operating System: (e.g., Ubuntu, Kali Linux ‚Äì specify if you used a particular distribution in the lab)**
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI): Bash Shell**
* **Linux Commands: ls -la, chmod**

## **Projects & Key Skills**

Below are some of the projects that highlight my capabilities. Each project directory contains a detailed `README.md` explaining the objectives, tools used, my actions, key findings, and lessons learned.

### **Google Cybersecurity Certificate Labs**
* **Use Linux commands to manage file permissions** 
    * Skills Demonstrated: In this activity, I managed file permissions in a Linux environment to enhance security. Tasks included checking current permissions, interpreting permission strings, modifying file and directory permissions, and handling hidden files and folders. This demonstrates the use of chmod and ls -la commands in managing file authorisations.
